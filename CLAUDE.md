Here are some genreal rules that I want you to folow:

* If you are going to change files make a new github branch beforehand to avoid breaking the current branch I am on. Commit the current changes before branching
* Always think through your approach before you start coding and ask the user if your proposed approach is correct detailing any limitations and the pros and cons.
